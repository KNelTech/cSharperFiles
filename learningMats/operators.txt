1.)Arithmetic operators:
~
+ add
- subtract
* multiply
/ divide
% modulo (Division remainder)
~
2.)Relational operators
~
== equals (int x = 3; int y = 4; bool a = x == y;)(so a would be equal to false)
!= not equals (int x = 3; int y = 4; bool a = x != y;)(so a would be equal to true)
>  greater than
>= greater than / equal to
<  less than
<= less than / equal to
~
2.5.)Relational operator usage
~
//so if x is the same as y then run the following code 
if (x==y); {
    print("x and y are equal");	
}
//we can create more conditionals
else if (x > y) {
    print("x is greater than y");
}
else {
    print("x and y are not the same");
}
~
3.)Logical operators
~
&& and
|| or
! not
~
3.5.)
~
bool a = true;
bool b = false;
//three non related functions utilizing initialized variables in this scope
if (a && b){
    print("both are true");
}

if (a || b){
    print("either or both are true");
}

if (!a){
    print("a is false");
}
